        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>I'm a PhD student in the <a href= https://hrbdt.ac.uk/>
          Human Rights, Big Data and Human Rights Project</a> at the <a href=https://www.essex.ac.uk/>University of Essex</a>. I'm researching the ways in which gender stereotypes are encoded into automated decision-making systems, particularly in the UK public sector. My supervisor is <a href=https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/mcgre64903/lorna-mcgregor>Professor Lorna McGregor</a>.</p>

        <p>I'm also occasionally a human rights gender consultant and advisor, with specific expertise in discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics. <a href="mailto:laura.carter@essex.ac.uk">Email me</a> for more information.</p>

        <!--<h2>Publications</h2>-->

        <h2>Work history</h2>
        <p> From 2011 to 2019, I worked at the International Secretariat of <a href=https://www.amnesty.org/en/>Amnesty International</a>, of which six years were spent in research and policy advice roles.</p>
        <p> Prior to this, I've worked as a caseworker for domestic violence and hate crime cases, a freelance maths tutor, a bartender, and an assistant language teacher for elementary and junior high school students in rural Wakayama, Japan. </p>
        <p> I have an MA in Gender Studies from SOAS and a BA in Mathematics from the University of Cambridge. </p>

        <h2>Board and advisory work</h2>
        <p> I'm a trustee of the <a href= http://www.feminist-review-trust.com/>
          Feminist Review Trust</a>, which allocates c.GBP25,000 to feminist projects worldwide annually. </p>


        <h2>Side projects</h2>
        <p> I run <a href=https://tinyletter.com/data-feminism>Data/Feminism</a>, a weekly(ish) newsletter that looks at algorithms, data and technology from a feminist perspective. You can view the archives <a href=https://tinyletter.com/data-feminism/archive> here.</a></p>
        <p> After one too many mindfulness sessions at work, I wrote a twitter bot that gives <a href=https://twitter.com/lifeadvicebot> individual self-care advice for coping with structural problems</a>.<p>
