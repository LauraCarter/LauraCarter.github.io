        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p> I'm a PhD student in the <a href= https://hrbdt.ac.uk/>Human Rights, Big Data and Technology Project</a> at the <a href=https://www.essex.ac.uk/>University of Essex</a>. 
         I'm researching the ways in which gender stereotypes are encoded into data-driven decision-making systems in the UK public sector: my reserach focuses on the use of data assemblages in children's social services in England.  
        My supervisors are <a href=https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/mcgre64903/lorna-mcgregor>Professor Lorna McGregor</a> and <a href= https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/ryanf84501/roisin-ryan-flood>Dr Roisin Ryan-Flood</a>.
    </p>
  
        <p> I'm currently an <a href=https://openlifesci.org/> Open Life Science </a> Fellow, part of the OLS-2 cohort which runs from September to December 2020. 
Together with <a href=https://twitter.com/brainonsilicon> Sophia Batchelor </a> and <a href=https://twitter.com/ismaelkhergar> Ismael Kherroubi Garcia</a>, I am working to build a community of practice for the Turing Way's <a href=https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/ethical-research/ethical-research.html.> Guide to Ethical Research. </a>
We aim to build open-source resources for reproducible, responsible and ethical data science, and a community to put these resources into practice.
This project builds on work I did while based at the <a href=https://www.turing.ac.uk/>Alan Turing Institute</a> in London as an <a href=https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/doctoral-students/laura-carter>Enrichment Student</a> from January to September 2020.</p>
        <p>I'm also occasionally a gender consultant and advisor, with specific expertise in human rights, and discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics. Past and current clients include <a href=https://frontlineaids.org/> Frontline AIDS</a>, <a href=https://www.edgeeffect.org/ >Edge Effect</a>, and the <a href=https://www.worldbank.org> World Bank Group.</a> <a href="mailto:laura.carter@essex.ac.uk">Email me</a> for more information.</p>
